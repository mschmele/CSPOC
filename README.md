A little demo app to test and learn about `clojure.spec`

## Project setup

- I'm using Leinengen, but chances are that you are as well. 
- If you're a fan of atom, the Proto-repl dependencies are already included.
- `clojure.spec` currently uses an alpha build of the language, but simply starting your repl in the project directory will handle all of that downloading and installing nonsense. Isn't that nice?
